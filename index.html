        <div class="sec6"><h3>Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular than the Taj <br>Mahal?</h3> </div>
        <div class="sec7"><p>Quite honestly, we can’t think of one.</p></div>
        <div class="sec8"><p>At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no declaration of love more apparent than<br>building a marble masterpiece for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to travel than seeing<br>its magnificence up close.</p></div><br>
        <div class="sec9"><p>After all, this is art. Built in Agra, <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/india">India</a> between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history. And, of course, it’s<br> the perfect opportunity to take some otherworldly photos. So, to help visitors prepare for their Taj<br> Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a little guide, enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts – from<br> Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the bases. </p></div><br>
        <div class="sec10"><p>Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond),<br> and so much more…</p></div><br>

    </div>
    <div class="mainsec2">
        <div class="subsec1"><h2>Before you arrive at the Taj Mahal</h2></div><br>
        <div class="subsec2"><p>That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal.</p></div><br>
        <div class="subsec3"><p>Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian<br> men, women and children who may ask to take photos with you.</p></div>
        <div class="subsec4"><p>To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour.<br> Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/india/golden-triangle-101271">8-day Golden Triangle tours</a> (now with <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/india/golden-triangle-solo-travellers-109795">solo-only<br> departures</a>!) to <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/india/highlights-india-and-nepal-102239">15-day trips dedicated to food</a>, to 19-day trips combining the <a>highlights of India</a><br> <a>and Nepal</a>.</p></div><br>
        <div class="subsec5">If you’re more pressed for time, you can check out the Taj Mahal on a whirlwind day tour from<br> Delhi. Check out <span>Urban Adventures</span> to see the itinerary that we’d recommend for this. And while<br>you’re at it, check out their day trips in<a href="https://www.urbanadventures.com/destination/Jaipur-tours"> Delhi, Jaipur,</a> <span>Varanasi</span> and <span>Mumbai</span>!</div><br>

        <div class="subsec7">The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you’re mentally <br>prepared, you’ll be fine. What’s to come is more than worth the wait…</div><br>
        <div class="subsec8"><h3>What to bring to the Taj Mahal</h3></div><br>
        <div class="subsec9">Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to have<br> minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in.</div><br>
        <div class="subsec10">You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:</div><br>
        <div class="subsec11">
            <ul type="square">
                <li>Passport</li>
                <li>Money</li>
                <li>Wate</li>
                <li>Medicine</li>
                <li>Camera</li>
                <li>Phone</li>
            </ul>
        </div><br>
  </div>
    <div class="mainsec3">
        <div class="sec-1"><h3>What to wear to the Taj Mahal</h3></div><br>
        <div class="sec-2">There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. If you want to enter the mosque, you will <br>need to cover your head, shoulders and knees.</div><br>
        <div class="sec-3">It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing and make sure you wear<br> sunscreen. Then again, Agra also gets very cold in winter (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too.</div><br>
        <div class="sec-4">If you visit with Intrepid, you’ll be taken there earlier in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid<br> the worst of the heat.</div><br>
        <div class="sec-5"><img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/India_Agra_taj_mahal_sunset_210.jpg"></div><br>
        <div class="sec-6">Useful tip from Ryan Turner, Intrepid’s Destination Manager for India:</div><br>
        <div class="sec-7">Having been to the Taj a few times, I’ve learnt the importance of wearing shoes that are <br>easy to remove. You need to take your shoes off when you go inside and the easier they are <br>to slip on and off the better. This actually applies to much of India – shoes with loads of<br> laces are hard!</div><br>
        <div class="sec-8"><span>Other things you need to know</span></div><br>
        <div class="sec-9">No food is allowed inside.<br></div>
        <div class="sec-10">Cigarettes and lighters are also not allowed.</div><br>
        <div class="sec-11">Tripods and additional lighting equipment need prior permission to be brought with.<br> Photography inside the mausoleum is prohibited. Most electronics (except cameras and small<br> video cameras) are not allowed.</div><br>
        <div class="sec-12">Be wary of touts, thieves and rude shop keepers. It’s a busy, high-pressure area, but keep your<br> wits about you and you won’t need to worry!</div><br>
    </div>
    <div class="mainsec4">
        <div class="subsec-1"><h3>When you’re at the Taj Mahal</h3></div><br>
        <div class="subsec-2">Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds (if<br> possible).</div><br>
        <div class="subsec-3"><img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/India_Agra_taj_mahal_crowds_185.jpg"></div><br>
        <div class="subsec-4">If you walk around to the right side of the Taj (as you approach the east gate), you can get an<br> amazing photo from the riverbank behind the Taj. (Always go in groups and get a rickshaw to<br> take you there and back cheaply.)</div><br>
        <div class="subsec-5">And simply focus on taking in all the magic. Even Intrepid leaders who see the Taj Mahal monthly<br> (or more!) remain in awe of it. <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/sana-female-intrepid-leader-india/">Sana Jinah</a>, one of the company’s inspiring female tour guides, has<br> some tips on how to do this:</div><br>
        <div class="subsec-6">The Taj Mahal is a place for exploring quietly on your own or with loved ones. So, once I’m<br> done briefing my groups I give them a good 2-3 hours inside the Taj. There are ways I try<br> to make the experience special and memorable for travelers, but if I say what they are then<br> they will no longer be surprises!<br>
            The Taj has such a charm. Every time I see it it looks different (due to the direction of the<br> sunlight). It’s so beautiful…</div><br>
        <div class="subsec-7">She also recommends those looking for optimum conditions try visiting the Taj Mahal at sunrise<br> on a clear day.</div><br>
    </div>
    <div id="mainsec5">
         <div id="sec1"><h3>Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal</h3></div><br>
         <div id="sec2">Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where you sit<br> on the bench and the grandeur of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop.</div><br>
         <div id="sec3"><img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_agra_taj-mahal_taking-in-the-surroundings.jpg" alt=""></div><br>
         <div id="sec4">But if you’re feeling creative and want to mix things up, there are tons of different angles worth<br> seeking out. </div><br>
         <div id="sec5">Below are some photography suggestions from Intrepid’s General Manager in India, <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/pravin-intrepid-manager-gender-equality-india/">Pravin</a><br> <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/pravin-intrepid-manager-gender-equality-india/">Tamang</a>. (His photography is amazing – <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/cities-india-street-photography/">check it out</a>!)</div><br>
         <div id="sec6">
            <ul type="square">
                <li>Shot from the arch of the main doorway</li>
                <li>Capture the reflection of the fountains that line the route towards the Taj Mahal’s main<br> platform</li>
                <li>Shot of Taj Mahal from the riverside with the reflection on the river</li>
                <li>Shot from the other side of the river, ‘Mehtab Bagh’, where you get a glimpse of Taj</li>
                <li>The Taj Mahal can also be shot from some parts of the Red Fort</li><br>
            </ul>
         <div id="sec7">You can also get great photos from the many rooftops of restaurants close to the Taj Mahal.<br> Unfortunately, Agra does get pretty smoggy, so winter can often have poor visibility earlier in the<br> day and around sunset. That said, this can make shots look very atmospheric!</div><br>
         <div id="sec8"><img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_agra_fog-taj-mahal.jpg"></div><br>
         <div id="sec9"><h3>What to do after visiting the Taj Mahal</h3></div><br>
         <div id="sec10">First, go back to your hotel room, take a shower, and revel in the relative peace and quiet. Then<br> explore these cool destinations both in and out of Agra:</div><br>
         <div id="sec11"><span>What to do in Agra</span></div><br>
         <div id="sec12">The Taj Mahal is, quite clearly, the star of the show in this northern Indian city. But the Agra Fort<br> is also stunning, especially if you didn’t get a chance to go to the Red Fort in Delhi. A 16th-century<br> Mughal monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, it’s a sight not to be missed.</div><br>
         <div id="sec13">Despite being located on the <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/india/golden-triangle-101271">Golden Triangle</a> tourist circuit, there’s less to do in Agra than in<br> many other Indian cities. It’s pretty polluted from the heavy industry (more on that later) and you<br> likely won’t spend too long there, whatever the trip.</div><br>
         <div id="sec14">One way that Intrepid tries to show visitors a different perspective on the country is by<br> (sometimes) taking travelers to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/12/23/sheroes-hangout-cafe_n_13830342.html">Sheroes Hangout.</a> Just blocks from the Taj Mahal, it’s a small cafe<br> run entirely by female acid attack survivors. Here, victims of attacks are employed and tell their<br> stories. It can be confronting, but also inspiring and memorable in equal measures.</div><br>

         <div id="sec17"><span>Where to go outside of Agra</span></div><br>
         <div id="sec18">There are various great destinations only a few hours drive (well, 4-7) from the Taj Mahal. Of these,<br> Orchha, Jaipur and Pushkar are all tourist-friendly, peaceful and beautiful places.</div><br>
         <div id="sec19">Orchha is a town that travelers often overlook. This is a shame, because it’s historic, laid-back<br> and has a bunch of beautiful temples. It’s not always on tour itineraries, but you CAN visit<br> it on <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/india/delhi-kathmandu-101281">this 15-day trip </a> from <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/nepal/delhi-to-kathmandu">Delhi to Kathmandu</a> (cooking demo and palace visit included!).</div>
         <div id="sec20"><img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_orchha_temple.jpg"><br></div>
         <div id="sec21">Chaturbhuj Temple in Orchha</div><br>
         <div id="sec22">Jaipur is much more well-known. Also known as the<a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/top-colourful-cities/"> ‘Pink City’,</a> the capital of Rajasthan is full of<br> chaos, charm and unique architecture. Visit the hilltop Amber Fort, haggle in the enchanting<br> bazaars, and consider taking a hot air balloon over the city to take it all in.</div><br>
         <div id="sec23">Pushkar is another underrated town. One of the oldest and most serene towns in India, it’s home<br> to Pushkar Lake, a sacred spot for Hindus that’s utterly dazzling at sundown. Because of its holy<br> nature, the vegetarian food here is simply unmissable. Visit on this <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/india/classic-rajasthan-101273">15-day trip all</a> around Rajasthan.</div><br>
         <div id="sec24"><h3>A final note about the Taj Mahal’s mud therapy</h3></div><br>
         <div id="sec25">As you may have <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/taj-mahal-mud-restoration/">read</a> or heard, the Taj Mahal has recently been undergoing a very thorough<br> clean. Yep, to be precise, a mud mask as of April 2018.</div><br>
         <div id="sec26">Why? Air pollution from factories in Agra had been slowly turning the Taj Mahal’s ivory-white<br> surfaces yellow – and this was one way of restoring them to their former glory. The work –<br> applying a clay traditionally used to clean marble to the entire structure of the Taj – was carried<br> out by the Archaeological Survey of India. And this work was part of a series of restorative projects<br> carried out on the historic site.</div><br>
